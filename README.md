Ansible Notes
What is Ansible?
Ansible provides open-source automation that reduces complexity and runs everywhere. Using Ansible lets you automate virtually any task. 
Ansible uses simple, human-readable scripts called playbooks to automate your tasks. You declare the desired state of a local or remote system in your playbook. Ansible ensures that the system remains in that state.

Ansible is designed around the following principle:
*Agentless architecture
*Simplicity
*Scalability and Flexibility
*Idempotence and predictability
